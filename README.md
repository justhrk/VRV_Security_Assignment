# Log Analysis Script for VRV Security Python Intern Assignment

This repository contains a Python script designed to process and analyze log files for cybersecurity insights. The script fulfills the following requirements:

1. **Requests per IP**: Counts and displays the number of requests made by each IP address in descending order.
2. **Most Accessed Endpoint**: Identifies the most frequently accessed endpoint along with its access count.
3. **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Flags IP addresses with failed login attempts exceeding a configurable threshold (default: 10 attempts).
4. **CSV Output**: Saves the results into a well-structured CSV file (`log_analysis_results.csv`).

The project demonstrates skills in file handling, string manipulation, and data analysis, crucial for cybersecurity-related programming tasks.
